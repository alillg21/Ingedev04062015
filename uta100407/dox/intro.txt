The system component functions are declared in the header file sys.h in sys directory.

They are implemented in the files:
 - TBX.C - (ToolBoX) tracing and conversion functions, container methods and simple supplementary functions of generic usage. Part of them is enabled in simulation mode only
 - I32.C - (Ingenico 32 bits) wrappers around U32 functions. These are the 32-specific implementations of functions declared in sys.h
 - E32.C - (Emv 32 bits) wrappers around EMV Kernel.
 - C32.C - (Crypto 32 bits) wrappers around SSA calls.
 - CHN.C - (CHannel) communication channels
 - MEM.C - (MEMory) non-volatile memory access functions

The header file def.h defines several macros that modify the behavior of all the application.

In particular, there are __DEBUG__ and __TEST__ macros that can be enabled during application development.

To enable an application-specific behavior one of the macro __CTL4SAE__, __ACI4TTN__, etc
should be defined (__CTL4SAE__ for the application number 4S developed for CTL server, __ACI4TTN__ 
for the application number 4T developed for ACI server etc).

The macro __PARIS__ should be defined if the testing is performed from Paris. 
It should be disabled if testing is performed by a local team. Normally this macro activates country code dialing.

The macro __FONT__ should be defined if a local font is used. In this case the related SSA version should be download

The primitive component functions are declared in the header file pri.h in pri directory.
They are implemented in the files:
 - FMT.C - (ForMaT) string formatting functions useful in payment application context
 - DLG.C - (DiaLoG) various dialogs
 - DBA.C - (DataBaseAccess) data base access functions
 - COM.C - (COMmunications) derived communication operations
 - STD.C - (STanDard) some standard algorythms
